INTRODUCTION:

   parallel allows to fully utilise a multi-processor system by
running several programs in parallel.

   Parallel comes with no warranty, to the extent permitted by law.
You may redistribute copies of Moon-Buggy under the terms of the GNU
General Public License.  For more information about these matters,
read the file COPYING of the source code distribution.

   Please mail any suggestions and bug reports to the program's author
Jochen Voss <voss@seehuhn.de>.  Your message should include the
parallel version number, as obtained by the command 'parallel -V'.


USAGE:

   The list of commands to be run is read from stdin or alternatively
can be supplied in a file using the -c option. Each line of the
command list is passed to /bin/sh in turn. The code is executed using
the maximal possible nice value, i.e. with a low priority feasible for
background batch processing.

   The number of parallel programs is configurable using the -n
option, by default the number of cpu cores is used. As soon as one of
the programs exits, another one is started, until the queue is
exhausted.

   See the parallel(1) manual page for details.


INSTALLATION:

   Parallel will probably only run on Linux/Unix systems.  Generic
installation instructions are in the file INSTALL.  Probably, you will
be able to install the program by just typing the following three
commands:

        ./configure
        make
        make install

The last of these commands will require root privileges.
